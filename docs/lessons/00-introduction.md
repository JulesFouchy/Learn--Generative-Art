## Forewords

*Welcome to this class!*

We will only assume some very basic knowledge of javascript and will teach you how to create amazing artworks and animations through code and maths.

We will be using a javascript library called [*p5*](https://p5js.org/) that allows us to do drawing easily. It is designed to be very beginner friendly, and is also quite powerful.

## Installation

I have an amazing template ready for you and I would highly recommend you use it for all your *p5* action:
:::tip Download
Download the template and check out the *ReadMe* to install everything!<br/>

*(NB: I also have [a template for using shaders inside p5](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/p5ShaderTemplate) ; we might talk about this later)*

## Documentation

*p5* has a wonderful website with tons of examples and a really nice documentation ; check it out whenever you are looking for something! https://p5js.org/reference

## Give me feedback

I tried my best to deliver the best learning experience possible. I am still a novice teacher though (and even if I were experienced, one never runs out of things to learn anyways). So your feedback is more than welcome and I will happily improve my classes with your help!

To do so, feel free to reach out to me directly or [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JulesFouchy/Learn--Cpp-And-Dev-Practices/issues).
